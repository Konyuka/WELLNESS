              <div class="flex items-center mb-8 pb-14 border-b border-gray-500">
                <!-- <img class="mr-14" src="zospace-assets/images/light-bulb-purple.svg" alt=""> -->

                  <p class="text-md text-gray-200">
                    Mararui Primary School is established on a 1.622 hectare plot which was once used as a coffee factory. This was done
                    through the effort of the local community and some valuable support from the World Vision Organization. It is located
                    about 5km off Thika Road and 2km from the Northern By-pass in Mararui village, Roysambu Ward, Kasarani District, Nairobi
                    County. It was taken over by the Nairobi City Council Education Department in 1998 and transformed into a public school.
                    Currently the school has an enrollment of nearly 900 pupils. Most of the students are children of dwellers of a small
                    village that has over the years evolved into a sprawling slum known as ‘Jua Kali’ and indeed a home to many that live in
                    abject poverty.
                    
                    The school has been experiencing water shortages when the supply from Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company is cut
                    off. This problem is aggravated due to lack of enough water storage tanks and the existing one has patched sections
                    which leaks from time to time. Our visit to the school really impacted us in many ways. The students are made to carry
                    water from their homes to school to provide water for use during the day. Due to water shortages, the school is exposed
                    to water related diseases and therefore a water storage solution is critical with girls facing hygiene challenges during
                    the menstruation.
                    
                    With the help from Kenya Irish Society and Roto Moulders Ltd, Kenya Women and Children’s Wellness Centre has installed a
                    5000 Litres water tank which will improve the safety of girls and boys that are faced with gender violations and abuse
                    from adults at the source of water outside the school.
                    
                    The handover of the water tank to the school was done on Friday, 10th July 2015. The headmistress of the school, Ms
                    Sanya, Parents Teachers Association representative Mr. Paul and the teachers were present to receive this noble gift.
                    Mr. Shem, Marketing Manager of Roto Molders Ltd commented that the company is glad to have contributed to the lives of
                    these children and promised to have the old tank repaired at no cost. Mrs. Sunita, Executive Director of KWCWC gave her
                    gratitude to the school for embracing this project and assured the management that KWCWC will continue to support the
                    school whenever possible. The officials of the school were thankful for the kind gesture.
                    
                    KWCWC will continue with its efforts towards reducing Gender Based Violence in many ways through Water and Sanitation
                    Health (WASH) programs, trainings and sensitizations to the communities

                    Kenya Women and Children’s Wellness Centre (KWCWC) Community Outreach Program works closely with the community based
                    football clubs in the informal settlements within kasarani sub-county. Among the local teams is SuperBentoz United
                    Football Club which comprises of young boys and girls ranging from ages 4 – 21 years old from Githurai region,
                    approximately 1.5 kms from the city centre. The club started 9 years ago and has presented 2 players to play in the MYSA
                    league ( Mathare Youth Sports Association) at international level in the Norway Cup Tournament in 2013 and Holland Cup
                    Tournament (2014) respectively.
                    
                    The COP team provides alternative means of spending their free time thus thwarting the social menances attributed to
                    Sexual and Gender Based Violence perpetuation. Studies demonstrate that idleness by the young pepole leads to high
                    incidences of sexual abuse in the sprawling informal settlements (KWCWC GBV study by J. Otsola, 2012).
                    
                    Evans Odenyo Onyango, a 22 year old coach who closely works with the football club asserts that “ engaging the young
                    soccer players creates in them the vigour to play in national and international football clubs”.
                    
                    On 27th January 2014, KWCWC and the Aston Villa Foundation made a courtesy call to more than thirty (30) young soccer
                    players in Githurai where the Executive Director of KWCWC Mrs. Sunita Nathoo and the Represeantive from the Aston Villa
                    Foundation Mr. Rajeev together with the community outreach staff provided soccer T-shirts from Aston Villa Football
                    club, goodie bags from KWCWC and other assorted stationaries. KWCWC and Aston Villa endeavoured to cordially work to
                    uplift the social lives of upcoming soccer players, create opportunities for their coaches to attain standard
                    international coaching skills, and inculcate life skills in prevention of Sexual and Gender Based Violence in the
                    region.
